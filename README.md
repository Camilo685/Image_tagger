This is a personal project.

It was created using the wxPython GUI, and the distributions were build with PyInstaller.
Using the distribution build doesn't requiere any installation, and it's self maintained (any modification to the source code it's auto-updated)

If you wish to run the scripts manually (Python) you will need to get the 4 .py files and run the init.py (make sure that the variable 'from_script' in the main.py script is set to True), the code will make sure to download the icons for the user interface.

For non distribution users
Requirements (later versions should work too!):

python==3.10

filetype==1.2.0

Pillow==9.0.1

PyGithub==1.59.0

Pypubsub==4.0.3

Send2Trash==1.8.0

wxPython==4.2.0

How it works?
You select a folder to save all your images, then start adding images (either whole folders or a selection)

The program gives an option to add descriptive tags to the images selected, the takes you to the editing/displaying panel, in which you can add more individual tags (descriptive or specific) to a desired image.

To save/discard the ones not modified close the panel and a promp will appear asking for instructions
In the search panel all the saved images can be filtered to look for ones that fit an specific set of tags.
